# Python Animations

A set of short Python animations that may be useful for teaching multi-slit diffraction. 
I have provided examples of from 1 to 5 equally-spaced inifinitesimal single slits.
The phasor for each slit is shown in blue and the phasors are shown added geometrically.
The resultant amplitude, the vector sum of the phasors, is shown in orange. As the animation evolves you can
see the complex periodic behavior of the amplitude.

In addition I have plotted a suitably scaled version of the total intensity (the square
of the amplitude) as a green curve so that the actual diffraction pattern is sketched out
as the animation runs.
